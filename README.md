MediaBox
========

A simple web interface to access to your media from anywhere.  Open ID
login with whitelisting. Open-source project, using Django, Python,
Backbone.js, HTML5, Bootstrap from Twitter.


Setup
-----

1. Install required python modules

        pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create database (sqlite3), and admin account

        ./manage.py syncdb

3. Create a symbolic links to your media collections:

        mkdir static/media
        ln -s /path/to/public/collection static/media/public
        ln -s /path/to/private/collection static/media/private

4. Import ID3 genre data to use as canonical genre meta data

        ./manage.py import_id3_genres

5. Synchronize meta data of media files from the filesystem into the database

        ./manage.py sync_media

6. Start local website on localhost:8000

        ./manage.py runserver

7. Visit http://localhost:8000/


Local settings
--------------

The default settings.py is suitable for development. To override some
settings, especially DATABASES and SECRET_KEY, create a custom
local_settings.py file, based on the included local_settings.py.sample
and call manage.py like this:

    ./manage cmd --settings=local_settings

Features
--------

- Browse directory of music files
- mp3 files are playable in the browser using Yahoo! WebPlayer
  (looking for a suitable alternative, implemented in pure html5)

Well that's pretty much it for now. And it's working fine like that. But that's not great.

Work in progress: (stuff that's working but not really used yet) 
- Import meta data from mp3 files and store in a local database cache for fast access
- Supported audio formats:

    - mp3
    - (more are coming soon, can be added easily using `mutagen`)


Technologies used or planned (for aspiring contributors)
--------------------------------------------------------

- django/python: database not used yet, but will be used to replace folder traversal
- a versioned and defined and stable ReST server as well to allow add-on's and alternate front-ends in the future, while not in code now it is thought about as features are added
- \_, Backbone, jQ.tpl all powerhousing the new responsive Bootstrap Framework based set of theme(s)
- multiple views per artist, album, playlist, etc all graceful as one would expect
- mutagen: used to get music file meta data, supports many audio formats
- webplayer by Yahoo!: the current media player, but it would be great to change this
  to a pure html5 implementation without Flash


Planned features (most important at the top)
--------------------------------------------

- Change the navigation: instead of page reloads folder by folder, load the entire
  collection on the client side into backbone objects and use js to navigate artists and albums.
- Search!
- Count how many times I listen to the same stuff
- Favoriting: albums, artists, songs
- Playlists!
- Add support for more audio formats: ogg, flac
  Note: the webplayer probably cannot play anything but mp3.
  A pure HTML5 player should have no problem with that.
